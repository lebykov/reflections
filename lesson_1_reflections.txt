By viewing the diff between two files you can quickly locate 
changes whithout scanning through the whole file. This 
simplifies finding bugs, typoes.

Having access to previous version of the file helps to retrieve
some features and code, which were put aside along the 
development, and appeared to be useful at this point.

The pros of manual commits: logially distinguished changes.
The pros of automatic commits: preserve loss of change due to 
forgivnes.

I think that Git version control system allows to save 
multiple files in one commit since this preserves connection 
between objects in files(functions, variables, etc.). This 
feature is very important for programmers. Other systems like 
GoogleDocs doesn't have such feature since they mostly used
for text editing, so there is no need to preserve connections
between objects in the files.

git log command views commits that have been made to the
repository. It has helpful options for filtering output
data: --grep - for specific keywords, --before/--after - for
specifying the date of the search and the time direction.
git diff command displays changes that have beem made in
the commit. It higlights added and deleted lines of code.

Reflection 6
With the help of version control you can roll back from the
buggy version of the program to the working version and 
with the help if diff option find lines witch have introduced
the bug.

I want to use Git for controling versions of my python project.
