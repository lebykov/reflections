Reflection1
I would want to use remote repository for several reasons: if 
threre are goin to be several people working on project,
if I'm going to use different working places, if I'm goin to 
backup projects.

Reflection2
I would like to pull changes manually instead of having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository since
i can specify which branch pull commit to.
