Reflection1
I would want to use remote repository for several reasons: if 
threre are goin to be several people working on project,
if I'm going to use different working places, if I'm goin to 
backup projects.

Reflection2
I would like to pull changes manually instead of having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository since
i can specify which branch pull commit to.

Fork copies repository from another user's github 
account to your github account without cloning to local 
repository. It creates link to original repository.
Clone copies github repository to your local repository. No
repository is created on the github.
Branch represents variation of the project.

The benefits of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally is that there will be less conflicts
to solve when pulling remote after some time. Since another 
user might have been commiting to it.

Reflection5
I woul use GoogleDisk and emails to collaborate without using 
Git or GitHub. This would be harder since there is no code 
specific features like ones in GitHub.
